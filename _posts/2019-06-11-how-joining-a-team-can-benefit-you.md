As an agent who’s new to the real estate business, should you join a team or stand alone?

In my opinion, **I don’t think there’s a better place to be than with a really good team.** Back when I started in the business (20 years ago), being an individual agent was more feasible because you could sustain yourself based on your sweat equity. In this day and age, though, it takes time to build a foundation that will allow you to build an income to support yourself.&nbsp;

If you’re a buyer agent and you join a team, you might get a lower commission split, but the fact is that buyer agent splits on most teams are equal to or greater than entry level wages for individual agents.&nbsp;

To calculate this margin, **talk to a few different team leaders and look at their per-agent production.** In other words, look at their numbers of sales and divide that by the number of agents on the team. If they don’t average at least 20 sales per year per agent, that’s probably not a team you want to join. Some teams make a lot of sales, but when you look closer, it’s just because they have a lot of agents on board—not because each agent actually sells a lot of homes.&nbsp;

I truly believe that we function according to the people we surround ourselves with, so if you decide to join a team, interview the team leader and make sure they show you their per-agent production. That will tell you whether they’re helping each person reach their potential or they’re just looking out for the team’s bottom line.&nbsp;

Joining a team and being an individual agent are two different philosophies, and I’m not saying one’s “right” or “wrong.” If you have an income that will allow you to go several months without making a lot of sales, you can absolutely enter the business as an individual agent and find success. It takes a sizeable financial commitment to stay on a level playing field, but it’s still possible.&nbsp;

**At the end of the day, what’s best for you depends on your circumstances.** If you’d like to talk more in-depth about this subject or you have any questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d be happy to speak with you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
